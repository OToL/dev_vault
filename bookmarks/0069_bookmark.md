- Explains how he gathered data about GPU HW market by combining Steam Hardware Survey and D3d12InfoDB
- List the different HW architectures which worth considering atm e.g. NVidia Turing, etc.
- Considers Driver support trends i.e. how much from release drivers for certain architectures drop support
- Go feature by feature (e.g. DXR, Mesh Shader, Shader Model, Sampler Feedback, etc.) and discusses the market share as well as the purpose/goal of it (performance, easier dev, etc.)
- Mention Direct Storage as feature people must use
- Takes several Game Archetypes and tries to define the minimum requirement for each in terms of both graphics features and HW
