Explains how to setup a agentic workflow and give the capability for the model to visualize & validate what it generates thanks to Playwright MCP.
This MCP, from Microsoft, is able to access, navigate and take screenshots of web pages.
Used as an input to another agent/task, the model can evaluate if the expected visual result is achieved.
