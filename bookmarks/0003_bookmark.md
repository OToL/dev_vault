- Comments the debate regarding who is responsible for bad UE5 game performances: Epic vs Developers
- Suggests that one of the cause could be how Engine features are presented and introduced to developers
- With UE5, almost all features are enabled by default (top down) as opposed to Godot & Unity where new projects are almost empty (bottom up)
- Concludes it is a UX problem i.e. the Engine should clearly communicates what features are enabled, their dependencies and overhead/impact to performance
